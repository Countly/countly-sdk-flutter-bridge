## What's Countly?

[Countly](https://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics and push notifications platform. It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: [the server that collects and analyzes data](https://github.com/countly/countly-server), and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.
